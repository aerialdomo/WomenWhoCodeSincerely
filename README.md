## Overview

We are making an iPhone Postcard App using our sponsor's API.
Sincerely's Ship API is highly awesome and enables you to take pictures and send physical postcards to real human beings!

Meetup at Sincerely, April 12, 2013

This is a work in progress. Branches will be structured to follow a logical lesson plan.

## Current Branch

* Choose a file from one of your social network/filesharing accounts using Filepicker.io (Dropbox, Facebook, etc)
* Add text, filter to the image using the Aviary SDK
* Print out the picture as a real-life postcard using Sincerely

### ConsumerCredentials.h

* Create a file named ConsumerCredentials.h
* Add API keys for these constants like so:

                #define kSincerelyAPIKey @"stuff"

                #define kFilepickerAPIKey @"stuff"
